#  KOMAL SINGH  

 *Senior Data Analyst* | Aspiring *Data Scientist* | Builder of Data-Driven Projects  

Hey there üëã thanks for stopping by my profile! I‚Äôm Komal, a data enthusiast and Senior Data Analyst with 6+ years of experience across e-commerce, financial, and healthcare industries. Day to day, my work looks like defining the right metrics, building data models, running ad-hoc analyses, and creating dashboards that make data easy to understand. I also spend time on LookML development and monitoring to keep everything running smoothly, while shaping data pipelines with dbt and Redshift. Recently, I‚Äôve been diving deeper into AI ‚Äî from building predictive ML models to exploring how Generative AI can make analytics smarter and faster. Outside of work, I enjoy tinkering with trading bots, experimenting with real-time BI, and building side projects that keep me learning and growing.
